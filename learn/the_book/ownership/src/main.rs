            // do stuff with s
        }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid

        //-- this is to make memory management cleaner and safer!
        //-- note: similar to concept of shallow copying, but with additon of invalidating the origin ptrhence the name "move"
    

    //---- Variable and Data Interaction - Clone

        }

        //-- int types have known size at compile and stored on stack -> copies inexpensive --> no shallow/deep copy diff

        //-- note: ints implement the "Copy" trait
            //-- if type has Copy trait, original variable still usable after assignment
            //-- types that implement Drop trait, they can't implement Copy too
